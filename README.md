Overview:
Looking at the python file, 
It will read the list of sentences from sentences.txt file, which was covered in the File Reading lecture. 
Then, it will keep track of the statistics across different sentences. 
In the function, it will access the global variables. 
It will randomly select a sentence and remove it from the sentence bank, which will print the sentence for the user to type.
Then, it will start a timer to track how long it takes for the user to type the sentence. 
When you user begins typing, it will get their input and store it in a variable, which will then end the timer. 
From the user’s input, it will calculate the time it took for the user to type the sentence. It will calculate the number of characters correctly typed by the user and the overall number of characters in the sentence. 
The accuracy feature will compare the user’s input to the original sentence. 
Then, it calculate the number of words inputted. 
From all of this, it will print the statistics. 
The user can continue to play the test, but if not, the program will exit and print their overall statistics. 

Purpose: 
Keyboarding is a technical skill that is quickly becoming central in education, the marketplace, and in people’s lifestyles as a whole. 
Typing helps you improve and learn new skills through a computer or other devices that is keyboard-based. 
You can improve your employability just because your typing skills can accelerate these learning processes. 

Difficulties I faced or overcame: 
I wanted the program to change the colors of the characters while the user was typing the sentence. For example, if the user typed in the correct characters, it will turn green, but if the user typed in the incorrect characters, it will turn red. It would have been easier for the user to locate where they made a mistake. However, I chose to not incorporate this, because it was overly complicated. 
Instead, I added the accuracy feature, which I thought I would not be able to include in this program. 

What I enjoyed: 
During my free time, I like to use this website, called MonkeyType, which inspired me to develop this program. I was able to use concepts from the course’s lecture to guide me through the process, which made it somewhat enjoyable and pleasant.
