Final Project

Your video should be a walk through, slides, screenshots, voiceover, and/or live action. Your video should somehow include your project’s title, your name and year,  and any other details that you’d like to convey to viewers. Upload your video to YouTube as “public” or “unlisted” and include the URL of the video in your README.md file and in canvas. 

Your video should be a general overview of the final product.

Include anything else you want to say, such as the difficulties you faced or overcame, the things you learned, what you enjoyed, etc, in a readme file.
